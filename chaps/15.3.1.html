Choosing what kind of classifier to use
</H2> 

<P>
When confronted with a need to build a text classifier, the first
question to ask is how much training data is there currently
available?  None?  Very little? Quite a lot? Or a huge amount,
growing every day?  Often one of the biggest practical challenges in fielding a
machine learning classifier in real applications 
is creating or obtaining enough training data. For
many problems and algorithms, hundreds or thousands of examples from each
class are required to produce a high performance
classifier and many real world contexts involve large sets of categories.
We will initially assume that the classifier is needed as
soon as possible; if a lot of time is available for implementation,
much of it might be spent on assembling data resources.

<P>
If you have no labeled training data, and especially if there are existing
staff knowledgeable about the domain of the data, then you should
never forget the solution of using hand-written rules.  That is, you write 
standing queries, as we touched on at the beginning
of Chapter <A HREF="text-classification-and-naive-bayes-1.html#ch:classification">13</A> . For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
if (wheat or grain) and not (whole
  or bread) then <!-- MATH
 $c = \mbox{\query{grain}}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="64" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1360.png"
 ALT="$c = \mbox{\query{grain}}$">

</BLOCKQUOTE>
In practice, rules get a lot bigger than this, and can be phrased
using more sophisticated query languages than just Boolean
expressions, including the use of numeric scores.  With
careful crafting (that is, by humans tuning the rules on development
data), the accuracy of such rules can become very high.
<A
 HREF="bibliography-1.html#jacobs90scisor">Jacobs and Rau (1990)</A> report identifying articles about takeovers with
92% precision and 88.5% recall, and
<A
 HREF="bibliography-1.html#hayes90construe">Hayes and Weinstein (1990)</A> report 94% recall and 84% precision over 675
categories on Reuters newswire documents.  Nevertheless the amount of
work to create such well-tuned rules is very large.  A reasonable
estimate is 2 days per class, and extra time has to go into
maintenance of rules, as the content of documents in classes
<A NAME="22924"></A>drifts
over time (cf. page <A HREF="properties-of-naive-bayes-1.html#p:concept-drift">13.4</A> ).

<P>
If you have fairly little data and you are going to train a supervised
classifier, then machine learning theory says you should stick to a
classifier with high bias, as we discussed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="the-bias-variance-tradeoff-1.html#sec:secbiasvariance">14.6</A> (page&nbsp;<A HREF="the-bias-variance-tradeoff-1.html#p:secbiasvariance"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/icons/crossref.png"></A>).
For example, there are theoretical and empirical results
that Naive Bayes does well in such circumstances
(<A NAME="tex2html3955"
  HREF="bibliography-1.html#forman04learning">Forman and Cohen, 2004</A>, <A NAME="tex2html3956"
  HREF="bibliography-1.html#ng01discriminative">Ng and Jordan, 2001</A>), although this effect is not necessarily
observed in practice with regularized models over textual data
(<A
 HREF="bibliography-1.html#klein02conditional">Klein and Manning, 2002</A>). At any rate, a very low bias model like
a nearest neighbor model is probably counterindicated. Regardless, the
quality of the model will be adversely affected by the limited
training data. 

<P>
Here, the theoretically interesting answer is to try to
apply <A NAME="22930"></A> <I>semi-supervised training
methods</I> .  This includes methods such as bootstrapping or the 
<A NAME="22932"></A>EM algorithm, which we will introduce in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="model-based-clustering-1.html#sec:modelclustering">16.5</A> (page&nbsp;<A HREF="model-based-clustering-1.html#p:modelclustering"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/icons/crossref.png"></A>).  In
these methods, the system gets some labeled documents, and a   
further large supply of unlabeled documents over which it can attempt
to learn.  One of the big advantages
of Naive Bayes is that it can be straightforwardly extended to
be a semi-supervised learning algorithm, but for SVMs, there is also
semi-supervised learning work which goes under the title of
<A NAME="22935"></A> <I>transductive SVMs</I> .  See the references for pointers.

<P>
Often, the practical answer
is to work out how to get more labeled data as quickly as you can.
The best way to do this is to insert yourself into a process where
humans will be willing to label data for you as part of their natural
tasks.  For example, in many cases humans will sort or route email for
their own purposes, and these actions give information about
classes. The alternative of getting human labelers expressly for the
task of training classifiers is often difficult to organize, and the
labeling is often of lower quality, because the labels are not
embedded in a realistic task context.  Rather than getting people to
label all or a random sample of documents, there has also been
considerable research on <A NAME="22937"></A> <I>active learning</I> , where a system is
built which decides which documents a human should label. Usually
these are the ones on which a classifier is uncertain of the correct
classification.  This can be effective in reducing annotation costs by
a factor of 2-4, but has the problem that the good documents to label
to train one type of classifier often are not the good documents to
label to train a different type of classifier.

<P>
If there is a reasonable amount of labeled data, then you are in the
perfect position to use everything that we have presented about
text classification. For instance, you may wish to use an SVM.
However, if you are deploying a linear classifier such as an SVM, you
should probably design an application that overlays a Boolean
rule-based classifier over the machine learning classifier.  Users
frequently like to adjust things that do not come out quite
right, and if management gets on the phone and wants the
classification of a particular document fixed right now, then this is
much easier to do by hand-writing a rule than by working out how to
adjust the weights of an SVM without destroying the overall
classification accuracy.  This is one reason why machine learning
models like decision trees which produce user-interpretable
Boolean-like models retain considerable popularity.

<P>
If a huge amount of data are available, then the choice of classifier
probably has little effect on your results and the best choice may be
unclear (cf. <A
 HREF="bibliography-1.html#banko01scaling">Banko and Brill, 2001</A>).  It may be best to choose a
classifier based on the scalability of training or even runtime 
efficiency.  To get to this point, you need to have huge amounts of
data. The general rule of thumb is that each doubling of the training
data size produces a linear increase in classifier performance, but
with very large amounts of data, the improvement becomes sub-linear.
